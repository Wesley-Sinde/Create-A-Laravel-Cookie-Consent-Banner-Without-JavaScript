# Create-A-Laravel-Cookie-Consent-Banner-Without-JavaScript
To comply with EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law, all the websites owned by or targeted the EU users should inform and get consent from visitors beforehand to store or retrieve any information from their devices. It protects the privacy of visitors by making them aware of how their information is being collected and used. Also, it gives visitors a chance to allow or not. We use a “Cookie Consent Banner” to inform and get that consent from visitors. In this tutorial, we are going to explore the possibilities and the capabilities of Laravel to implement such a thing in our Laravel application, of course, without using any JavaScript code.
